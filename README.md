This program is firmware developed for a personal USB keyboard project. The keyboard only contains 9 keys-- currently, these are 7 Binary keys, a Shift key, and a "begin/end typing" key (now referred to as the Type key). To type a character on this keyboard, one must begin by pressing the Type key. Next, the user may press the remaining 8 keys to select a desired keystroke. Each of the 8 keys (7 Binaries and 1 Shift) correspond to a single binary digit, and the combined byte of digits corresponds to a unique keystroke. As a hypothetical example, 0b0000 0001 might correspond to typing the letter 'a', 0b0000 0010 might correspond to the letter 'b', and so on. Bit 7 of this byte is the shift key, which augments the keystroke in the same manner as a conventional keyboard. Building on the previous example, 0b1000 0001 would correspond to typing the letter 'A', etc. Once the desired combination has been input, the user must press the Type key once more to transmit the letter to the computer.
